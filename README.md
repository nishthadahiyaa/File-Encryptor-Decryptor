## Introduction

This project implements a File Encryption and Decryption system using process management and inter-process communication techniques.

## Key objectives:
	‚Ä¢	Securely encrypt and decrypt files using a key from a .env file.
	‚Ä¢	Handle multiple files in a directory via a task queue.
	‚Ä¢	Demonstrate multiprocessing, semaphores, and synchronization techniques.
	‚Ä¢	Implement modular design with reusable components for file I/O, process handling, and cryptographic logic.

‚∏ª

## Project Motivation

The project was built to:
	‚Ä¢	Explore low-level file handling in C++..
	‚Ä¢	Understand process creation (fork, exec) and management.
	‚Ä¢	Apply synchronization techniques such as semaphores and locks.
	‚Ä¢	Create a practical project that can encrypt/decrypt multiple files efficiently.

 ## Features
	‚Ä¢	File-based encryption & decryption with a configurable key stored in .env.
	‚Ä¢	Process queue management for handling multiple tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Multiprocessing (fork & exec) to run encryption/decryption in separate processes.
	‚Ä¢	Error handling for invalid input, file access errors, or missing keys.
	‚Ä¢	Custom task management system (Task objects with serialization/deserialization).
	‚Ä¢	Supports batch encryption/decryption of all files inside a directory.

‚∏ª

## System Components Used
	‚Ä¢	Processes: Created using fork() and exec() for parallel execution.
	‚Ä¢	Semaphores & Locks: To synchronize access when multiple processes run.
	‚Ä¢	File I/O: Custom IO class for managing file streams.
	‚Ä¢	Environment Loader: Reads encryption key from .env.
	‚Ä¢	Task Queue: Stores encryption/decryption jobs.
	‚Ä¢	Makefile: Automates compilation of project binaries.

‚∏ª

## Working Flow
	1.	User specifies a directory path and action (encrypt/decrypt).
	2.	The system scans all files in the directory.
	3.	Each file is wrapped into a Task object with metadata.
	4.	Tasks are pushed into a queue.
	5.	Process Management executes tasks one by one (or via child processes).
	6.	Files are modified in-place with encryption/decryption applied.

##  Limitations
	‚Ä¢	Only supports basic Caesar-like shift encryption (not cryptographically secure).
	‚Ä¢	Requires .env file containing the numeric key.
	‚Ä¢	Encryption modifies files in-place (no backup).
	‚Ä¢	Currently sequential execution (multiprocessing code included but commented for testing).

‚∏ª

## Potential Extensions
	‚Ä¢	Add advanced cryptography algorithms (AES, RSA).
	‚Ä¢	Implement multithreading instead of forking.
	‚Ä¢	Add logging system for tracking tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Support file backups before modification.
	‚Ä¢	Add a GUI frontend for user interaction.

## How to Run

1. Clone Repository

git clone <repo-link>
cd File-Encryptor-Decryptor

2. Build Project

make all

3. Run Encryption/Decryption

./encrypt_decrypt

Enter the directory path and action (encrypt/decrypt) when prompted.

4. Run Cryption Executable Directly

./cryption "filename.txt,ENCRYPT"


‚∏ª

## Example
	‚Ä¢	Input file: test1.txt ‚Üí HELLO WORLD!
	‚Ä¢	Key in .env: 1234
	‚Ä¢	After encryption: scrambled binary data.
	‚Ä¢	After decryption: restored to HELLO WORLD!.

üëâ This README makes the project look serious and systems-level, not just ‚Äúbasic.‚Äù

Do you want me to also create diagrams (system flow/UML) for this project so you can directly add them to GitHub like you did in your Proxy Server repo?
